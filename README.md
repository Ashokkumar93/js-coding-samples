## Variable scope

### Global scope
A variable declared outside of all the function or without a `var` keyword is a global variable in Javascript. This variable can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

```
// global scope
var a = 1;
b = 2;

function one() {
  alert(a); // alerts '1'
  alert(b); // alerts '2'
}
```
If you use a `this` keyword outside an object, it resolves to `window` object which is a global object in Javascript.
```
// global scope
this.a = 1;
b = 2;
console.log(this.a);   // 1
console.log(window.a); // 1
console.log(window.b); // 2
```
### Local scope
If the variable is declared inside a function it takes the functions as its scope. This variable can be accessed within the function and not from outside the function. 
```
// global scope
var a = 1;

function one() {
  // local scope
  var a = 2;
  alert(a); // alerts '2'
}
alert(a); // alerts '1'
```
If you omit the `var` keyword wihtin the function it is declared as a global variable.
```
function one() {
  // not local but global, 
  a = 2;
  alert(a); // alerts '2'
}
one();
alert(a); // alerts '2'
```
If a variable resolved in a local scope, it will not check upwards towards global scope. For example, if the function `one` has a variable `a` declared it will take precedence over the global scope within the function.
### Block scope
ES6 introduced `let` and `const` which declares variables known only to the _enclosing_ parenthesis `{}`. For example, `for` loop or `if` condition.
```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log(i); // undefined
```
### Catch clause Scope
There is also one special scope in Javascript which like `let`. It is the variable in the `catch` clause. This shodows other global and local variables in the same name, but only available within the `catch` block.
```
try { 
  throw 10;
} catch(e) {
  console.log(e); // 10
}
console.log(e) // Uncaught ReferenceError: e is not defined
```
## Context
Often scope and context are confused among the developers. Scope refers to the visibility of the variable and context refers to the value of the `this` keyword.

### `this` in Global scope
In a global scope, `this` always refers to the `window` object. All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the `window` object.
```
console.log(this);
// logs: Window {postMessage: f, blur: f, focus: f, frames: Window, â€¦}
```
### `this` with new
If scope is in the method of an object, context will be the object the method is part of.
```
function User() { 
  console.log(this);
}
new User(); // User {}
```
If we call a function using the `new` keyword, the context will then be set to the instance of the called function.

### `this` with bind
If we bind a function explicitly with some object, then the `this` inside function will be set to the object we bind.
```
function greet() { 
  console.log('Hello ' + this.name);
}
var obj = { name: 'John Doe' };
var greetFn = greet.bind(obj);
greetFn(); // Hello John Doe

// calling greet function normally will take window object for this.
var name = 'Albert';
greet(); // Hello Albert
```
### `this` inside method
If we call a method of an object, then `this` will be automatically set to the current object.
```
var obj = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello ' + this.name);
  }
};
obj.greet(); // Hello John Doe
```

## Closure
### What is Closure?
 A Closure is created when an inner function tries to access the scope chain of its outer function meaning the variables outside of the immediate lexical scope. It means the inner function can access the outer function's variables.
 ```
 function greet() {
    name = 'John Doe';
    return function () {
        console.log('Hi ' + name);
    }
}
greetLetter = greet();
greetLetter(); // logs 'Hi John Doe'
```
 A closure can not only access the variables defined in its outer function but also the arguments of the outer function.
 ### Closure access outer scope
 Closures store references to the outer function's variables; they do not store the actual value. Closures get more interesting when the value of the outer function's variable changes before the closure is called. And this powerful feature can be harnessed in creative ways, such as this private variables.
 ```
 function userid () {
    var id = 999;
    // We are returning an object with some inner functions
    // All the inner functions have access to the outer function's variables
    return {
        getID: function ()  {
            // This inner function will return the UPDATED id variable
            // It will return the current value of id, even after the function changes it
          return id;
        },
        setID: function (theNewID)  {
            // This inner function will change the outer function's variable anytime
            id = theNewID;
        }
    }

}

var mjID = userid (); // At this juncture, the celebrityID outer function has returned.
mjID.getID(); // 999
mjID.setID(567); // Changes the outer function's variable
mjID.getID(); // 567: It returns the updated id variable
```

## `call`, `apply` and `bind`
Call and Apply functions are used to change the context while calling a function. To use the call or apply function, you just need to call it on the function instead of invoking the function using a pair of parenthesis and pass the context as the first argument. The function's own arguments can be passed after the context.
### using `call`
Instead of calling the function directly, add `call` after the function name and pass the context as the first parameter.
```
function greet(greeter) { 
  console.log(greeter + ' ' + this.name);
}
var obj = { name: 'John Doe' };
greet.call(obj, 'Hello');
```
### using `apply`
The difference between `.call()` and `.apply()` is that in Call, we pass the rest of the arguments as a list separated by a comma while `apply` allows us to pass the arguments in an array.
```
function greet(greeter) { 
  console.log(greeter + ' ' + this.name);
}
var obj = { name: 'John Doe' };
greet.apply(obj, ['Hello']);
```
We can also pass the context value as `null` if it is not used inside the function.
```
Math.max.apply(null, [2, 4, 6]); // 6
```
_Call_ is slightly faster in performance than _Apply_.
### Using `bind`
Unlike Call and Apply, Bind doesn't itself call the function, it can only be used to bind the value of context and other arguments before calling the function.
```
function greet() { 
  console.log('Hello ' + this.name);
}
var obj = { name: 'John Doe' };
var greetFn = greet.bind(obj);
greetFn(); // Hello John Doe
```
